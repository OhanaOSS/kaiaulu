# kaiaulu
Kaiaulu is the [front-end application for hale](https://github.com/ohanaOSS/hale) and apart of OhanaOSS, together they're helping make privacy for families more accessible as a distributed social network.

This application is in Alpha as we expand into the various features already built out in the latest major release of OhanaOSS hale.

## How To Deploy
This project uses Facebook's Create-React-App as a baseplate and has [extensive docs on deploying](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) just about anywhere. This application is designed as a standalone "portal" that connects to [hale servers](https://github.com/ohanaOSS/hale). This application connects to hale servers by storing a base url directed to where your server is located (i.e. example.com/).
